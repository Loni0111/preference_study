  <h3 align="center">Subjective Preference Study for Education Website Development</h3>

  <p align="left">
    In this project, we are interested in learnig a subject preference from users to help develop educational website that fits the best tastes of most users. Here are the steps to achieve this goal:
	
1. Test
In order to capture the individual differences in these "tastes", we set up a visual preference test. In this test, the dataset involves 3 categories (flowers, houses and paints) of images, each has more than 400 images with 2 displayed on each page. The test participants will make their choice on the prettier one from their points of view. The test is setup on Psychopy and the test distribution website, pavlovia.org.

2. Data Analysis
The raw data comes from the test are .csv files. The data are read and cleaned with a Jupyter notebook code. In order to demo the current progress, please click into the binder link below with appropriate environmental configurations:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Loni0111/preference_study/HEAD

please run the cells in the jupyter notebook step by step to get the correlation between the objects and variables, such as the image layouts, the image categories, etc.

**If you want to modify the code, please clone the whole repository to your local machine and push it onto the github repository with correct commit comments.**

3. Deep Learning Model
Please find the "Deep Learning Model.ipynb" from the link above, and follow the steps inside to run the deep learning model
